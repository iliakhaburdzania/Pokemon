# Pokemon
Test project

external libraries used: Kingfisher (it's a easy to use and lightweight library for fetching and caching images. this was crucial for this app)

dependencies management: Pods (although Swift Package Manager is supported by Apple it has many problems and is not stable enough yet, so I used good old cocoapods, which never betrayd me :) )
